\f0\fs26 \cf2 \cb3 'Redefining the old'\
\
Keith Crosby is a robotic-ist and artist, focusing upon the interactions between nature and mechanism.\'a0 His piece "Refining the Old" is based around exploring this interaction by deconstructing the mechanical and reconstructing it as natural objects and entities.\'a0 Keith engages both the mind and the spirit with his work, causing the observer to explore their own views on technology and nature; both in interaction between them and the difference between the two.}
